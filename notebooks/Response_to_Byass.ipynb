    "## Contradictory Pregnancy Status\n",
    "Deaths among women aged 12 to 49 accounted for\n",
    "1,884/11,984 (15.7%) of the cases, and 458 (24.3%) of these\n",
    "deaths were classified as ‘Maternal’ in the PHMRC dataset.\n",
    "However, 17/1,884 (0.9%) of these deaths had contradictory\n",
    "pregnancy status information in the VA data (for example,\n",
    "both pregnant and recently delivered at death).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response:\n",
    "Byass's concern about 17 observations with contradictory pregnancy status refer to observations where the respondent said 'Yes' to `a3_10`: 'Was [name] pregnant at the time of death?' and also said 'Yes' to `a3_18`: 'Did she die within 6 weeks of childbirth?'. Byass clearly interpretted this question as with six weeks AFTER childbirth. Some respondents clearly interpreted this question as \"Would she have given birth in the next six weeks if she had not died?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be shown by by examining the question `a3_11`: 'For how many months was she pregnant?' The survey question asked in units of months, although the database stored the results in days. (All the responses are multiples of 30.) It's valid to assume that seven months pregnant can be interpretted as AT LEAST seven months. 15 of the 17 observations were at least seven months pregnant. It was reasonable and consistent for the respondent to say the decedent was within six weeks of childbirth."

    "The very high proportion of VA interviews reporting respiratory symptoms in the PHMRC dataset is also worth noting. Table 3 shows rather non-specific relationships between respiratory symptoms and respiratory causes of death in the PHMRC data, which need further investigation and explanation. One possibility is that many patients in tertiary facilities may receive oxygen therapy in the final stages of an illness leading to death, which may be interpreted as respiratory difficulties by family and friends when later responding to a VA interview."

    "By extension, this and similar issues also raise questions of the validity of using tertiary facility deaths as the evidence base for VA methods. For example, since all the injury cases in the PHMRC data were hospitalized, clearly none of them could have been instantaneous or near-instantaneous fatalities. On closer examination, many of the VAs for injury cases also reported a range of symptoms not obviously associated with their injuries by the time they died in hospital; but, according to the PHMRC protocols, any ‘third-party written account’ of an injury makes that injury the cause of death, irrespective of further clinical details [7]."

    "## Inconsistencies between cause of death and symptoms\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, there were cases within the PHMRC database which showed blatant inconsistencies between hospital cause of death and responses to some VA questions. The most obvious were the 147 cases recorded as stillbirths in hospital but which were described as neonatal deaths in VA interviews, and the 90 hospital maternal deaths described as neither pregnant nor recently delivered in VA interviews. There is no way of knowing from the dataset whether these reflected data quality issues either in the hospital causes of death or VA material, or whether VA respondents were actually, either knowingly or unwittingly, presenting a different picture."
